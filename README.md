### Community patch / Anticheat

The community patch portion of this mod is similar to Blue Sentinel for Dark Souls III. It aims to mitigate the damage that malicious cheaters can do, and allows you to identify, kick, and block them.

All in all, Blue Acolyte has hundreds of patches for different cheats which range from simple annoyances like being crashed to game progression soft-locks and save file bricking.

In the case that a cheater still manages to ruin your save file, the mod also automatically creates backups of your save file whenever a new multiplayer session begins. This way even if something gets by the mod, you can restore a backup and not lose too much progress on your characters. If this happens please let me know and I'll try my best to block the cheat in future updates.

Please note that this tool cannot identify cheats not sent over the network to begin with, and is not a catch all solution to end all cheating.

### Quality of life improvements

The quality of life portion of this mod includes:
Accurate ping measurements to each player, complete with basic statistics such as minimum, maximum, and average ping.
Integration of Steam blocking for malicious players
Save backups when entering a new multiplayer session
Invasion overhaul, where using the cracked red eye orb will search all maps for potential invasions, as opposed to just the place you're in, similar to the Wex Dust﻿* mod for Dark Souls III
The cracked red eye and blue eye orbs are no longer consumed on use
You can view your session time remaining in the overlay
You can enable infinite SM matchmaking upwards (meaning you will be able to invade anyone above your current SM)
You can see whether the host of the world has a giant seed active which makes enemies aggressive toward invaders

* Wex dust is an invasion QoL mod which removes the map restrictions when searching for invasions. This means you can invade anyone, anywhere so long as they are in your matchmaking range and in an online enabled area.

All of these are optional features for the mod, and can either be toggled in the BlueAcolytePref.ini file, or switched on/off in-game using the assigned hotkeys to do so at runtime.

### Can this soft-ban me?

No, the mod works around the in-game anti-cheat and is undetectable.

### Installation

You should use Blue Acolyte as a stand-alone protection tool. Compatibility with other mods is not tested and may introduce either ban risk, instability, or both.

Download the mod from the 'Download' tab or the GitHub mirror
Extract the package you downloaded, and move the following files to your Dark Souls II folder (usually in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS II\Game")
Edit "BlueAcolytePreferences.ini" to your liking.

To uninstall the mod, you just have to remove these files, or if you just want a temporary uninstall, rename "dinput8.dll" to something like "BlueAcolyte.dll", then change it back when you want to use it again.

###  FAQ

Q) Does this work for the original Dark Souls II (32-bit)?

A) No, sorry.

Q) Does Blue Acolyte check/log IP addresses?

A) No, however you should be aware that playing any P2P game can reveal your IP address to other players.

Q) I've found a bug with the current release, can I report this?

A) Please do, I'll try to get around to fixing it as soon as possible.

Q) I know of / have been affected by a cheat that wasn't detected by this mod, can I report this?

A) Absolutely, please don't expect any cheats that aren't sent over the network to begin with to be detected though.

Q) Won't this tool be beneficial for cheaters, or give an advantage in PvP?

A) Not really - some people feel like seeing the player list gives an advantage, however there are options to turn it off in the ini file. You can also turn off the part of that mod that makes cracked eye orbs infinite if you're not comfortable using it.

Q) Can we see the source code?

A) No, while I understand people can be distrustful of mods like this, I'm unwilling to make the source code public. Past experience has told me that certain groups are more interested in either crashing or exploiting protection tools than contributing to them, so I'd much rather not.

Q) Is this a virus?

A) No, the mod is limited to Dark Souls II (when it is running) and does nothing outside of the process. The mod will attempt to connect to GitHub once on start-up to check the mod version, but this is only to check whether to it is up to date or not.

Q) Can I modify or redistribute this mod?

A) No, sorry. Please do not modify, repackage, or redistribute this mod anywhere without my permission.

Q) I have a question not answered here.

A) If you need more information, or wish to report a bug, have a suggestion etc. please make a post about it, or send me a direct message.
